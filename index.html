            <h1 style="font-size: 50px">THIS PROJECT IS SO COOKIE CUTTER!!!</h1> 
                <p>A <strong>cookie cutter</strong> in American English and <strong>biscuit cutter</strong> in Commonwealth English is a tool to<br>cut out cookie/biscuit dough in a particular shape.</p>
                <p>They are often used for seasonal occasions such as:</p>
       <ul>    
            <li>
                <p><strong>Birthdays</strong></p>
            </li>
        	<li>
                <p><strong>Christmas</strong></p>

                <p>Cookie cutters are used for cutting <strong><i>pastries</i></strong>, <strong><i>tea sandwiches</i></strong> and many other items.</p>
                <p>They are used when well-known decorative shapes are desired, or for large<br>batches of cookies where <strong><i>simplicity</i></strong> and <strong><i>uniformity</i></strong> are <strong><i>required</i></strong>.</p>
                <p>See example below...</p>

               <h3><i>COOKIE CUTOUTS</i></h3>
               <p><strong>Most commonly made of copper, tin, stainless steel, aluminium, or plastic. Cutouts are the simplest of the cookie cutters; the cutter is pressed into cookie dough that has been rolled flat to produce the shape of the cutter's outline. To keep the dough from sticking, they are often dipped in flour or sugar before use.</strong></p>

                <h3><i>COOKIE DETAIL IMPRINTS</i></h3>
                <p><strong>Commonly made of copper, tin, or plastic. Detail imprints are similar to cutout cookie cutters, except that detail imprints also mark the surface of the dough.</strong></p>

                <h3><i>COOKIE MOULDS</i></h3>
                <p><strong>Usually made of wood, ceramic, or plastic. Springerle moulds are the oldest examples of such, and are popular for Scottish shortbread. A cookie mould typically has an ornate design debossed into the surface; the mould is pressed into the cookie dough to produce an embossed design. These moulds may be flat disks or may be in the shape of a rolling pin.</strong></p>

                <h3><i>COOKIE PRESSES</i></h3>
                <p><strong>An automated or hand-operated cookie press, also called a cookie gun, is used to make large batches of cookies quickly. The cookie dough is extruded onto the baking sheet in ornate shapes that would otherwise be too difficult or time-consuming to create by hand.</strong></p>

                <h3><i>COOKIE CUTTING SHEETS</i></h3>
                <p><strong>Used for larger volumes, a production cookie cutting sheet is a piece of study plastic the size of a full sheet pan that essentially has dozens of cutout cookie cutters mounted on to it. A sheet of cookie dough, already rolled to the correct thickness, is laid on top of the cutting sheet, and a rolling pin is used to press the dough down on to the sharp edges of the cutting sheet. The cut cookies fall through the holes into the sheet, into their properly spaced positions on the baking sheet. The scrap dough and cutting sheet are removed, and the pan is ready for baking. Cookie cutter sheets allow high volume production without the time or risk of moving cut cookies to baking sheets.</strong></p>
